# Project : Automate a Full-Stack App with CI/CD & IaC

## Introduction  
This project will deploy a containerized full-stack application to AWS using modern cloud practices. We'll implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Pulumi, establish CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and ensure proper security and monitoring. This comprehensive project combines frontend, backend, and database deployment with automation best practices.

## Starter Files  
No pre-existing files are required, The project will be built from scratch, though you may reference previous activity materials including:  
- React frontend  
- Node.js backend   
- Pulumi infrastructure   


## Requirements  
We'll deploy a complete cloud-native application with these components:

### Containerize the Application  
For both frontend and backend:  
- Create production-ready Docker images  
- Configure proper port exposure (3000 for React, 5000/8080 for Node.js)  
- Include all runtime dependencies  
- Optimize image layers for efficient deployments  

### Set Up AWS Infrastructure (via Pulumi)  
**Frontend Hosting:**  
- Configure S3 bucket with static website hosting  
- Set up proper bucket policies and CORS configuration  
- Implement CloudFront CDN (optional stretch goal)  

**Backend Services:**  
- Launch EC2 instance (Ubuntu 20.04/Amazon Linux 2)  
- Install Docker and configure auto-start  
- Set up proper security groups for API access  

**Database Layer:**  
- Provision RDS instance (PostgreSQL/MySQL)  
- Configure private subnet placement  
- Set up connection pooling parameters  

### Implement CI/CD Pipeline  
**GitHub Actions Workflow Must:**  
- Build and test both frontend and backend  
- Deploy frontend to S3 (with cache invalidation)  
- Deploy backend to EC2 via SSH/Docker commands  
- Implement rollback mechanism for failed deployments  
- Use GitHub Secrets for all credentials  

### Configure Security  
**IAM Configuration:**  
- Least-privilege roles for both CI/CD and runtime  
- Instance profiles for EC2  
- Secure parameter storage for database credentials  

**Network Security:**  
- Security groups that only allow:  
  - HTTP/HTTPS to frontend  
  - API traffic to backend  
  - Backend-only access to RDS  
- VPC configuration with proper subnet isolation  

### Implement Monitoring  
**CloudWatch Setup:**  
- Application logging from both frontend and backend  
- API performance metrics (response times, throughput)  
- Database performance monitoring  

**Alert Configuration:**  
- Deployment failure notifications  
- API error rates  
- System health (CPU, memory, disk)  
- Database connection thresholds  

### Test the Complete System  
Verify:  
- Frontend can communicate with backend API  
- Backend successfully connects to RDS  
- All security controls are effective  
- Monitoring alerts trigger appropriately  


## Deliverables  
The complete project submission must include:  

1. **Source Code Repository** containing:  
   - Frontend (React) and backend (Node.js) source  
   - Pulumi infrastructure scripts  
   - GitHub Actions workflow files  

2. **Live Deployment:**  
   - Public URL for the React frontend  
   - Accessible API endpoint for the backend  
   - Screenshots of working application  

3. **Documentation** covering:  
   - Complete deployment process  
   - Security implementations (IAM, networking)  
   - Monitoring and alerting configuration  

*Professional implementation with proper security and reliability is more valuable than UI polish.*  

## Conclusion  
This full-stack cloud deployment project integrates critical modern DevOps practices including Infrastructure as Code, continuous deployment, and cloud security. By completing this project, you'll demonstrate comprehensive skills in AWS service integration, automation pipelines, and production-grade deployment strategies essential for cloud-native application development.
