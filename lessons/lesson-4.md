# Lesson: Full-Stack CI/CD Automation: Frontend, Backend, and Database

## Introduction

Full-stack CI/CD automation enables seamless deployment of all application layers—frontend, backend, and database—through automated pipelines. By eliminating manual processes, teams achieve consistent, efficient, and reliable releases while reducing errors and accelerating delivery. This lesson explores strategies for automating each layer and coordinating deployments across the full stack.



## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you will:

1. Understand the benefits of full-stack CI/CD (consistency, efficiency, reliability) and its challenges (dependencies, testing).
2. Automate frontend deployment (e.g., React/Angular) using AWS S3 and GitHub Actions.
3. Configure backend deployment (e.g., Node.js/Python) to AWS EC2 with SSH or CodeDeploy.
4. Provision and manage databases (e.g., AWS RDS) using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Pulumi.
5. Implement end-to-end testing and dependency management for coordinated full-stack releases.

### What Does Full-Stack CI/CD Automation Mean?

Full-stack CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automation is all about streamlining the process of deploying every part of an application—frontend, backend, and database—without manual intervention. Instead of deploying each layer separately, full-stack automation ensures that the entire application is built, tested, and released in a smooth, coordinated way. This approach helps teams deliver updates faster while maintaining consistency across all components.

### Why Is Automating Frontend, Backend, and Database Deployments Important?

Automating deployments across all layers of an application brings several key benefits:

- **Consistency** – When the frontend, backend, and database are deployed together, you avoid issues like version mismatches or broken features due to incomplete updates.
- **Efficiency** – Manual deployments are slow and error-prone. Automation speeds up releases, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than managing deployments.
- **Reliability** – Automated testing and deployment reduce human errors, leading to more stable releases.

### Challenges of Deploying Multiple Layers Together

While full-stack automation is powerful, it comes with its own set of challenges:

- **Dependencies** – The frontend might rely on a specific backend API version, and the backend might need certain database schema changes. If these dependencies aren’t managed carefully, deployments can fail.
- **Coordination** – Deploying everything in the right order is crucial. For example, updating a database schema before the backend is ready to handle it can break the application.
- **Testing** – End-to-end tests must cover interactions between all layers to catch issues before they reach production.

## 1. Automating Frontend Deployment

### Frontend Deployment Overview

The frontend (built with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js) typically consists of static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that need to be hosted on a web server or cloud storage. Automating this process involves:

1. **Building the Application** – Compiling and optimizing the code (e.g., using `npm run build`).
2. **Uploading Artifacts** – Deploying the built files to a hosting service like AWS S3, Vercel, or Netlify.
3. **Configuring Performance Settings** – Setting up CDN (Content Delivery Network) and caching rules to ensure fast load times.

### Example: Deploying to AWS S3

AWS S3 is a popular choice for hosting static frontend apps. The deployment process includes:

1. Building the app (e.g., generating a `dist` or `build` folder).
2. Uploading files to an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI or SDK.
3. Enabling static website hosting on the bucket.

#### Example GitHub Actions Workflow:

```yaml
name: Frontend Deployment to S3

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to S3
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
        run: aws s3 cp build/ s3://my-frontend-bucket/ --recursive
```

A CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions can automate this workflow—triggering a build and deployment whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

## 2. Automating Backend API Deployment

### Backend Deployment Overview

The backend (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.) runs the application logic, handles database interactions, and serves APIs. Automating its deployment involves:

1. **Building the Application** – Compiling code (if needed) and bundling dependencies.
2. **Deploying to a Cloud Service** – Using platforms like AWS EC2, Google Cloud Run, or Azure App Service.
3. **Configuring Infrastructure** – Setting up scaling, logging, and monitoring.

### Example: Deploying to AWS EC2

EC2 is a common choice for running backend services. The deployment steps include:

1. Building the backend (e.g., installing dependencies, compiling).
2. Deploying via SSH (e.g., pulling the latest code and restarting the server) or using AWS CodeDeploy.

#### Example GitHub Actions Workflow:

```yaml
name: Backend Deployment to EC2

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to EC2
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v0.1.10
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.EC2_USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_KEY }}
          script: |
            cd /var/www/my-app
            git pull origin main
            npm install
            pm2 restart my-app
```

A CI/CD pipeline can handle this automatically—running tests, building the app, and deploying it to the server whenever new code is merged.

## 3. Automating Database Provisioning

### Database Provisioning Overview

Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) need to be set up correctly and kept in sync with application changes. Automation helps by:

1. **Defining Database Configurations** – Specifying instance size, storage, and network settings.
2. **Provisioning with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Using tools like Terraform or Pulumi to create and manage databases.
3. **Managing Updates & Backups** – Automating schema migrations, backups, and scaling.

#### Example Pulumi Script (TypeScript):

```typescript
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";

const db = new aws.rds.Instance("my-db", {
    engine: "mysql",
    instanceClass: "db.t3.micro",
    allocatedStorage: 20,
    username: "admin",
    password: "my-secret-password",
    skipFinalSnapshot: true,
});

export const dbEndpoint = db.endpoint;
```

## Conclusion

Full-stack CI/CD automation unifies frontend, backend, and database deployments into a single, streamlined workflow. By leveraging tools like GitHub Actions, AWS services, and IaC, teams can deploy updates faster, minimize errors, and maintain consistency across environments.
